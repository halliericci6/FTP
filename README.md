# FTP
FTP Client-Server Program:

The client provides 4 commands: ls, get, put, exit. The ls (CC_LS) command will list all files in the current directory.  The get (CC_GET) command, followed by a string, filename, will save a copy of the file specified by the user from the server.  The put (CC_PUT) command, followed by a string filename, will allow the client to copy a file in their local environment to the server.  The exit (CC_EXIT) command will terminate the client.
